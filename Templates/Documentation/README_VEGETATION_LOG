   August 31st, Pisa, work with Antonello Provenzale

   Equations of the model in vegetation.pdf

- validated and modified module VegPassive

   we need LOW value of seed (0.01). The D term is very strong
    
   introduced a function death(T): plants death is now function of the temperature,
   the parameter dTdead determines the plant tolerance thermal limit
   all files changed accordingly, including integrate.f (in the module)

   WE WILL NEED TO IMPLEMENT A NEW CONVERGENCY CRITERION ON VEGETATION

   We need to evaluate the idea of introducing an altitude correction (for
   Antarctica, but not only). Can be made dynamical (enters in EBM equation)
   In this case, Earth validation should be re-done

- corrected VegAlbedoFB module

   there was a mistake in module_albedo_surf.f

   now veg fb is positive (decreases albedo increases temperature).
   we should consider the idea of exploring a negative albedo (putting clouds
   where the vegetation is)

   introduced new Dune planet, tested by Antonello, and we verified that the
   (positive) vegetation feedback is in action

   consider the possibility of a careful parameter exploration

   CARBON FEEDBACK!!!

   CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE A DAISY WORLD
